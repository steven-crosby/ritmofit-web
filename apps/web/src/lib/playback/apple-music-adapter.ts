/**
 * Apple Music playback adapter — wraps MusicKit on the Web (v3) behind the
 * `PlaybackAdapter` contract. MusicKit is a page-level singleton that owns the
 * audio stream, the subscriber authorization, and catalog availability; this
 * adapter only remote-controls it (configure/authorize, setQueue, play, pause,
 * seek, stop) and never touches audio bytes (music-providers.md, D19). Apple's
 * terms are strict: no download, proxy, cache, decode, or analysis — "shortening"
 * a track is only ever a saved playback window over the untouched provider stream.
 *
 * Two things differ from the SoundCloud adapter and shape this file:
 *   1. MusicKit speaks SECONDS; the playback contract speaks milliseconds, so
 *      every boundary converts (`msToSeconds`).
 *   2. `seekToTime` needs a now-playing item, which exists only once playback has
 *      started. The runtime can `seek()` a mid-track entry BEFORE `play()`
 *      (runtime.ts), so a pre-play seek re-cues via `setQueue.startTime` and only
 *      a live seek uses `seekToTime`.
 *
 * Unlike SoundCloud (one hidden iframe per track, removed on destroy), every
 * track's adapter shares the one MusicKit instance, so `destroy()` drops only
 * this adapter's listeners and halts audio — it never tears the singleton down.
 * The developer token comes from the same `GET /providers/apple_music/config`
 * endpoint the connect flow uses; tokens live in memory only, never logged or
 * persisted (AGENTS.md), and are never used for catalog/BPM shortcuts.
